## Basic concepts

- **Host**: The user who creates a live room will be the host of the room. By default, the host can start a live and has control over who can speak in the room.
- **Participant**: Participants are users who watch the live stream but have no permission to speak.
- **Co-host**: Co-hosts are users who have permission to speak in a room.
- **Co-host seat**: Co-host seats are virtual seats in a live room representing the permission to speak in the room. Only users in the co-host seats can turn on their mic and speak in the room.
- **Make co-hosts**: The host of a room can invite any participants in the room to be a co-host.
- **Request to co-host**: A participant can request to take a co-host seat to become a co-host.
- **Leave a co-host seat**: A co-host can leave or be removed from a co-host seat and become a participant.
- **Face beautification**: A host can set up face beautification and face shape retouch features to make him look the way he wants before the live starts.
- **Audio effects**: A host can choose music accompaniments and voice effects after the live starts.
- **Virtual gifting**: Users in a live room can send virtual gifts to each other.
- **Text chat**: Users in a room can interact with host and co-hosts by sending real-time text messages or emojis during live streaming.

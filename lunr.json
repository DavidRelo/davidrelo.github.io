You can create single-host, multi-host live streaming sessions with audio effects, face beautification, and more features provided by ZEGOCLOUD. With ZEGO Live, users can create a live room to host, watch live video streaming events, invite participants in the live room to co-host, and more. Participants can send text messages to interact with the host and co-hosts in real time. ZEGO Live can cover typical scenarios include live video streaming, live online classes, live-stream shopping/e-commerce, or live game streaming. To know the ZEGO Live solution more intuitively, check our tutorial video: Basic concepts Host : The user who creates a live room will be the host of the room. By default, the host can start a live and has control over who can speak in the room. Participant : Participants are users who watch the live stream but have no permission to speak. Co-host : Co-hosts are users who have permission to speak in a room. Co-host seat : Co-host seats are virtual seats in a live room representing the permission to speak in the room. Only users in the co-host seats can turn on their mic and speak in the room. Make co-hosts : The host of a room can invite any participants in the room to be a co-host. Request to co-host : A participant can request to take a co-host seat to become a co-host. Leave a co-host seat : A co-host can leave or be removed from a co-host seat and become a participant. Face beautification : A host can set up face beautification and face shape retouch features to make him look the way he wants before the live starts. Audio effects : A host can choose music accompaniments and voice effects after the live starts. Virtual gifting : Users in a live room can send virtual gifts to each other. Text chat : Users in a room can interact with host and co-hosts by sending real-time text messages or emojis during live streaming. Why ZEGO Live Various live engagement formats With ZEGO Live and ZEGOCLOUD’s AI-powered audio effects, face beautification capabilities, you can create single-host, multi-host, and cross-room co-hosted live streaming sessions to meet the needs of different live engagement scenarios.
